## Self Reflection
Overall throughout this trimester I feel like I have grown a lot as both a person and a programmer. I learned a lot this tri, such as how to use github pages to run a site publicly or learning how to us installations in vscode such as brew or ruby. I am very thankful for the time I spent. I feel like I have really solidified my skills in python coding and continued to build the basline for javascript though I am still less confindent in it. I feel the projects this year have been both educational and challenging. In the end I feel as though my work this year was up the par with my personal standards for myself and though I could use some practice following directions I feel like I did all that I could.
