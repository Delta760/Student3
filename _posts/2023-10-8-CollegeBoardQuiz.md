Question 6:
I did not know what the IETF was before this quiz but after looking it up I now understand that they work to develop standard protocols for online communication.

Number 22: was a bit confusing due to the output not seeming optimised to the purpose of the function. I realise now that the output is only supposed to show whether it was hot or not.

Question 39:
I had some trouble figuring out what the answer was here but after some careful thinking I realised it was That Open standards allow for all hardware and software to communicate.

Overall I feel like I didn't need any help with the coding or critical thinking portions of the test but instead the standards for the internet or strangely worded questions.
